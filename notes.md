Step 1: Create the Twitter (X) sign in/up page - Will need icons from https://fontawesome.com/search?q=twitter&o=r&f=classic%2Cbrands

Step 2: Figure out how to incorporate Google and Apple OAuth
(2.0?)

Step 3: Create structure for "Create Account" and "Sign in", but
don't, yet, add functionality as that will require a built
database on the backend to store the data. OR, create a "demo"
user/pass combination?

Step 4: Create the UI for the signed in version of the site. - Revisit

Step 5 (and so on): Once in working order, redo using a JS framework.
